Projects
========

Hello! My name is William Silva. I'm a CS student at Northeastern University.

My Github currently consists of mainly school assignments- most of which were done in pairs. While more than one 
person was working on the code, I always completed a significant portion of the work and I believe that
this code reflects my personal coding abilities very well.
I also recently added a small C++ program which takes advantage of SFML library.

I would recommend checking out both 'School_Assignments/Java/FUNDIES2_Space_Invaders_Project' and
'OBJECT-ORIENTED-DESIGN_Bakery_Project' as those are the largest and most impressive projects that I have
worked on. 
For the first, I worked in a group with two others to create a clone of the Space Invaders 
game in Java.
For the second, I worked in a pair to construct a console-based application meant for a made-up bakery that
is capable of managing orders, items, and customers.
