Projects

Hello! My name is William Silva. I'm a CS student at Northeastern University.

My Github currently consists of school assignments- most of which were done in pairs. While more than one 
person was working on the code, I always completed a significant portion of the work and I believe that
this code reflects my personal coding abilities very well.

I would recommend checking out 'School_Assignments/Java/FUNDIES2_Space_Invaders_Project' as that is the
largest and most impressive project that I have worked on. I worked in a group with two others to
create a clone of the Space Invaders game in Java.
