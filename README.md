Hello! My name is William Silva. I'm a CS student at Northeastern University.

My Github currently consists of school assignments- most of which were done in pairs. While more than one 
person was working on the code, I always completed a significant portion of the work and I believe that
this code reflects my personal coding abilities very well.
